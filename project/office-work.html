            <h2>Then and Now</h2>
            <p>Growing up, trees to me have always been, Ponerosa Pine, Aspen, Juniper/Cedar Trees, Pinyon and Pine Trees. Man, was I wrong! Trees are not simply trees! There is so much more that goes into forest than simply deciding to cut trees down. There is much more to a tree than the broad and incorrect term of Pine Tree. Growing up in Beaver, I thought I knew what I knew and was not aware of what I didn't know. This is up to a year and some change of days did I not know what I didn't know about trees. How did this come to pass? It began with a call from the Forest Service telling me about a job offer. I acceptted and am so glad I did. I am now able to look at trees and see characterstics that are fascinating or concerning. The neatest part, I have just barely reached the surface. How did I do this? Let me take you on a small tour of my year.</p>
