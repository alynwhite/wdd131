            <h2>What is Forestry</h2>

            <p>Forestry is the application of scientific, economic, and social principles to attain specific objectives in the care of a forest. It focuses on the management of both human needs and the needs of the land/forest. The purpose of forestry is to apply scientific, economic and social principles to manage the demands of put on the land in a sustainable way

            <h2>History of Forestry</h2>
            <p>Forest and forest products are a huge part of humanities living. From early times of humanity, the forest provided food, shelter, fueld and materials for tools and weapons. It has gradually evovled to more complex uses for humanity but the materials do not change.</p>
            <p>It is attributed to Leonhard Baumann, a German forester, to be one of the pioneers of forest management in the 16th century. Around this time, the realization came that the forest was not an inexhustible resource. It takes time to grow trees!</p>
            <p>Gradually the idea of sustainable yield started to take hold. Hans Carl von Carlowitz wrote in his published book about the idea of sustainable yield. He proposed that forests shoudl be managed in a way that balances harvesting with replanting to ensure long-term sustainablity. (Sylvicultura Oeconomia, 1713) This idea laid the foundation for modern forestry.</p>

            <h3>Forestry: USA</h3>
            <p>The  <a href="https://www.eforester.org/Main/About/History/Main/About/History.aspx" id="forestry-para">Society of American Foresters</a> wrote a history on where Forestry began and where it is now. It is accredited to Gifford Pinchot(who was educated in Europe) having been the first in America to profesionally manage a forest at the Biltmore Estate in 1889. In 1891 Congress pass the Forest Reserves Act that created 40 million acres of forestland in the U.S. A few years later, the Organic Act was passed. The Organic Act allowed for a organization of management for the land.</p>
            <p>After World War II environmental concerns arose, one of these concerns was about deforestation and destroying habitation. These concerns are continued to be a topic today along with the challenges of logging, economics, land conversion, climate change and the increase demand of forest products.</p>

            <h2>Then and Now</h2>
            <p>Growing up, trees to me have always been, Ponerosa Pine, Aspen, Juniper/Cedar Trees, Pinyon and Pine Trees. Man, was I wrong! Trees are not simply trees! There is so much more that goes into forest than simply deciding to cut trees down. There is much more to a tree than the broad and incorrect term of Pine Tree. Growing up in Beaver, I thought I knew what I knew and was not aware of what I didn't know. This is up to a year and some change of days did I not know what I didn't know about trees. How did this come to pass? It began with a call from the Forest Service telling me about a job offer. I acceptted and am so glad I did. I am now able to look at trees and see characterstics that are fascinating or concerning. The neatest part, I have just barely reached the surface. How did I do this? Let me take you on a small tour of my year.</p>
